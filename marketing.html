			<h1>Communication message and objectives</h1>

		<p>We want to increase traffic on our website and social media accounts at the end of the campaign to prove we have raised awareness of how our brand relates to NFT. Our most important goal is for our target group to be able to identify themselves with our garments and be unique in a way they want to. 
		A similar brand to ours is the streetwear brand “Overpriced”. Overpriced describes itself as a brand that creates “fashion for the crypto generation”. Its co-founder Leighton James told Hypebeast: “We are a group of artists looking to create art-powered crypto fashion that aims to challenge the conceptions of what luxury fashion is”  (Elan, 2021). What we took as an example for us, from them is that they want to change the term “fashion” as a physical piece of clothing to something online in the digital world. We see that as a chance to make people feel comfortable and nice-looking not only at their workplace but in the virtual world as well. However, from our interviews and polls on social media, we got that people are not yet familiar with how that (NFT) works. In other words, we will first educate/ provide information to the public about the process and offer them an actual product that is unique for each person who purchases from us. </p>
		<p>Reach objective - We want to reach 500 people on Instagram and 1000 people on TikTok by the 12 of April</p>
      	<p>Affect objectives- We want our visitors/followers to feel special and curious to be part of a unique and luxurious community by the end of the campaign (until the 12 of April)</p>
		<p>Response objectives- The goal of the brand is to have at least 300 people click on each post by the end of the campaign on Instagram, 50 likes on TikTok on a video, and 20% visits on the website (until the 12 of April).</p>
		<p>Media objectives: The social media channels we will use are Tik Tok (100 followers) and Instagram (120 followers).
		</p>

			<h1>Target audience</h1>

		<p>Description of the demographic and lifestyle: With the internet making the world smaller and people connected, our target audience is based greatly in first-world countries like the Netherlands. According to Statista Research Departments (2022) “ Western Europe had a social network usage penetration of 79% at the beginning of 2021.” (Newcom and Inzicht, January 2020). We target people with expert to medium knowledge regarding cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. Their lifestyle is ever developing and coping with the new trends in investments and owning digitally valued art pieces.</p>
		<p>Age:  25-35 years old</p>
	  	<p>Gender:  non-specific</p>
		<p>Income: Elite class</p>
		<p>Education: Higher education diploma. It requires them to have knowledge of social media trends and how to purchase online as well as interest in tech and art and their collaboration.</p>
		<p>Career:  High paid above the standard, directors/managers, influencers, celebrities</p>
		<h1>Media behaviour of the target audience:
		</h1>

	  	<h3>What platforms/social media do they use:</h3>

		<p>Individuals from our target group tend to use social media mainly for communication, however, in 2020 a big percentage (57%) use Instagram for entertainment and finding new brands next to sharing photos, videos, etc., the numbers have a steady growth each year especially when the pandemic of COVID-19 started. Other apps that take a bigger percentage like Facebook (82%) and WhatsApp (89%) they sue for reading news and messaging. (Statistiek and Eurostat, 2020)
		</p>

		<h3>Activity on social media platforms:</h3>

		<p>Facebook is the platform that remains on top in statistics about which media platforms our target group uses. However, people still have their profiles but since it became known that the platform does leak private information, consumers lost faith and do not spend much time as well as do not use it for finding reliable (Department, 2022). Meanwhile, this is still happening, millennials became more oriented to using Instagram and TikTok, especially during the pandemic. These apps were a great alternative to having fun and finding new businesses or brands over the past two years. By the end of 2021, TikTok and Instagram had the most downloads and millennials were the second largest group using these social platforms (Statista, 2021). Looking at more statistics we are now sure that Millennials do use Instagram in recent years more often to find fashion brands and purchase from online shops. They even prefer checking those social media platforms as a form of trust towards them rather than seeing an ad on the television or on a big billboard (Pengue, 2021). </p>
		
		<h3>What brands do they like:</h3>

		<p>We looked up which were the most liked and the most popular brands online in 2021: on top of the list there was always Gucci (Beauloye, 2021). It is not a surprise since the luxurious brand changed its marketing strategy to digital storytelling, brighter colors, and of course, they dress a lot of celebrities unlike before. Moreover, luxurious brands like Gucci, Dior, or Channel will always be liked by individuals with enough income to afford them since they are history in the fashion industry (Insider, 2018) (insider, 2018).On the other hand, looking at their website and photos on social media we got inspired to make ours. Nowadays streetwear has become very popular and well-known brands like the ones mentioned above stay up with the trends combining high fashion with streetwear: like hoodies. What our potential consumers would want is exclusivity: The concept of possessing something that no one else has, yet without being excessive about it (Lang, n.d.).</p>
		
		<h3>How should you position your message:</h3>

		<p>Nowadays a person spends a big portion of money and time online which has become an inseparable part of our lives. That is why our main purpose is to differentiate our product/brand from the other fashion-related brands online or already in digital fashion. We offer something new, not the hoodie itself but the whole package: a hoodie, a physical product with a scannable code that leads the consumer to the actual product- a digital art piece.  A product for the elite class tech lovers, who need to differentiate, a Decoded hoodie is a piece of clothing that provides presents one’s uniqueness through the merge of physical and digital. Unlike “Overpriced “which we consider a competitor, we give an actual garment (Haaff, 2019). We strongly believe in facts and the latest research show that our chosen target group that we can gain more trust and a potential purchase if we use videos and engaging content (Pengue, 2021).</p>
		<h3>What do we want to communicate:</h3>
		<p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,1)">As said above we want to communicate that our brand is clearly new since the NFT world is still at an early age in the digital world, especially in fashion. We offer something new and attractive as well as quality products. Decoded is offering a fascinating experience by purchasing not only a high-quality garment but a piece of the new digital trend as well making it exclusive and unique. However, we kept in mind that it’s a new term even for people interested in art, tech, and fashion combined. That is why we made sure that on our website and social media platforms everything is explained well making us trustworthy and thoughtful which is something valued in brands by individuals nowadays  (Teixeira, 2021) </p>
